1) Estimate short-rate system (pg. 20) with unkown factors using least squares
    - get delta_0, delta_1
2) The rest of the parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood
    - with each iteration, A and B need to be iteratively calculated
    - I could see how this could get very sketchy really fast


IDEA!!

Use uncertainty in forecasts (distributio between high and low) to inform pricing pricing kernal. This might lead to a different estimate of the term premium. Could also not include it, but see how it correlates with the implied size of the term premium.
