1) Estimate short-rate system (pg. 20) with unkown factors using least squares
    - get delta_0, delta_1
2) The rest of the parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood
    - with each iteration, A and B need to be iteratively calculated
    - I could see how this could get very sketchy really fast
